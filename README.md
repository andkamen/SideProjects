# Side Projects
Collection of varios problems/games I've worked on

Some of those are as old as 2013-2014, others are just snipets of code I wanted to test or ideas I wanted to explore.
Some examples of the various things inside are:

-SurviveSoftUni - a top down shooter I helped write as a project in SoftUni

-bulls and cows - something I wanted to play vs the computer

-dumino - a tool to help me win in https://igrivi.com/dumino/game â˜º 

-some really old project Euler problems I tackled for fun

-other
