# Side Projects
Collection of varios problems/games I've worked on

Some of those are as old as 2013-2014, others are just snipets of code I wanted to test or ideas I wanted to explore.
Some examples of the various things inside are:

-IteratedPrisonersDilema -> IPD simulation that can evaluate and track the perforamance of different strategies when placed in a user defined context. Can simulate the evolution of a population of over 15 different strategies over time or check one off performance of a set of strategies vs each other. 

-SurviveSoftUni - a top down 2d shooter I helped write as a project in SoftUni. Randomised loot, smart AI enemies that use pathfinding algorithms, random level generation, various weapons and others

-bulls and cows - something I wanted to play vs the computer

-dumino - a tool to help me win in https://igrivi.com/dumino/game â˜º

-Dumino2 - refactored the code to use a recursion so that search is no longer hardcoded and can be used in various sized grids up to a desired word length. 

-some really old project Euler problems I tackled for fun

-other
